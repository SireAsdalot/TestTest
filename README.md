# The Test

I've never done this before, so thank you for spending time on this.

## Description

A simple test case to see if typing partial/full usernames will give the proper suggestions.

## How to execute
You can just open it and run it. 

## Tools used
Pycharm
Selenium

## Authors and acknowledgment
I'd like to thank all the guide writers, stack overflowers who provide alternative codes for when the one I was trying to use wasn't working. I'd also like to thank You for the opportunity!

## Notes

For the registration popup, they did show up, however, I had no way of closing the popup in automation. I got the CSS of the X button, but any way I tried, it simply did not close it. I could have done a very roundabout way of opening -> clicking on one -> end test -> repeat for all 3 buttons, but it felt redundant.
For the languages showing, I'm not sure if that's an old thing, or a future thing. The layout (like the "show more" button being different) seems different from the time the cases were written.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to get into Allure...
